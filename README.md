# onoffswitch

onoffswith.net was hosted on wordpress in godaddy for many years. However the godaddy managed hosting was poorly managed and so the site was often redirect hacked.  This is a raw wordpress export of all my old blog entries and is available statically via github pages at http://devshorts.github.io/onoffswitch

Unfortunately I removed the original site before backing up image assets, and so those are now defunct.
