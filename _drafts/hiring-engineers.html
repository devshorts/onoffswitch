<p>Yes, another hiring engineers blog post. </p>
<p>I've been on both sides of the interviewing circuit many times. I've moved around in my career and never been afraid to look for new opportunities, and I've been on hiring teams looking to hire new people. It's been written about endlessly before, but there's nothing more infuriating than asking, or being asked, trick questions that don't show the candidate or the team much of anything.</p>
<p>Interviewing, like security and testing, is all about layers.  There's no one size fits all question, or even questions.  To find truly great candidates is a layered approach consisting of quality screening, code collaboration, discussion, and questions.</p>
<h2>The Resume Filter</h2>
<h2>The Phone Screen</h2>
<p>A good phone screen can weed out 90% of the candidates who make it through the resume filter.   From an interviewers side, its important to be prompt. And when I mean prompt, I mean if you said 3pm you better call at 3pm on the dot. A candidates first real impression of you is whether you are on the ball or not.  Showing up 5 minutes late is 5 minutes of the candidate thinking "are they even going to call? whats going on?". At least thats what goes through my mind when I'm interviewing.  </p>
<p>From there its good to introduce yourself, the company, and lay out the plan for the next hour. Is it going to be code questions? Screen share? Etc.  I personally like starting with some basic "are you full of shit" questions. Things like "whats a linked list?", "whats a thread do?" are easy for pretty much anyone.  At this point if someone is any good they start to ease up since you've softballed the easy stuff.  If you do a screen share, doing a simple problem like calculating how much someone owes in taxes if you give them a set of brackets is great. It doesn't require fancy magic, it can be solved in any language using primitive constructs: for loop, classes, the plus sign.  No crazy gotcha's.  That said, a good candindate will talk through a lot of things that aren't even required for the problem. Things to listen for are are they asking questions, are they explaining their decisions, are they having fun with it? </p>
<p>It's just as important to sell yourself to the candidate as it is for them to you. Not paying attention, or not asking your own followup questions is a sign to the candidate that you don't care and their company doesn't care. It also might signal that you suck to them, and nobody wants to go work for sucky people.</p>
