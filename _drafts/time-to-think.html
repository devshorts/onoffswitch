<p>- talk about how its beneficial to turn off and do other things<br />
- engage in hobbies, interests other than computers<br />
- find article that talked about "work is for the workstation"<br />
- sitting at your desk doesn't count, there are too many distractions, coworkers, pending bugs, broken builds, IM's, etc.<br />
- get outside, relax, don't think about work<br />
- the best ideas come when you aren't pushing yourself on them<br />
- avoid burnout, if you aren't thinking clearly take a break. eat a snack, take a walk.<br />
- proper nutrition and excessive can help a lot, trying to work through these things is ineffective<br />
- know how you work, what works for you might not work for someone else and vice versa</p>
