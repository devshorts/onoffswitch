<p>- talk about professionalism when publishing open source or public code<br />
- read between the lines when someone asks a question. try to determine what they are asking, if its a bug, if its not a bug.<br />
- as the creator you know all the details about what you made, give people the benefit of the doubt and be patient when explaining it<br />
- remember that your answers reflect on you and the things you are related to, a poorly judged comment can undermine lots of work<br />
- this applies not only to public source but internal interactions as well</p>
