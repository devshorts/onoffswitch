<p>Any good engineer has their own tools of their trade: keyboard, mouse, and licenses to their favorite editors (oh and a badass <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/performance-work-chairs/embody-chairs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chair</a>).</p>
<p>I work now on an Ubuntu box and I wanted to get my logitech MX mouse's zoom button to act as middle click. I really like this functionality since its easy to copy, paste, close windows, and open new links with this button.</p>
<p>However, the button mapping in Ubuntu isn't trivial. On windows you used the setpoint program to do it and called it a day. But in linux land you need to put more work into it.</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.logitech.com/t5/Mice-and-Pointing-Devices/Guide-for-setup-Performance-MX-mouse-on-Linux-with-KDE/td-p/517167" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a> is a great tutorial describing how to do it, but for the lazy, here is the mapping you need.  </p>
<p>[code]<br />
&quot;xte 'mouseclick 2'&quot;<br />
  b:13+Release<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>What this says is "when button 13 is clicked, then released, issue a mouseclick 2 command". <code>xte</code> is a program that simulates mouse and keyboard events, and <code>xbindkeys</code> (whose config you edit to set the xte mapping) is a program that lets you bind one key or mouse event to another key or mouse event.</p>
<p>Once I did this and started up <code>xbindkeys</code> then my zoom button (button 13) now worked as middle click (mouseclick 2).  </p>
