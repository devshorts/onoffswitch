<p>Figured I'd spend part of the afternoon and play with clojure but was immediately thwarted trying to install <a href="http://leiningen.org/">leiningen</a> on windows via powershell. I tried the msi installer but it didn't seem to do anything, so I went to my <code>~/.lein/bin</code> folder and ran </p>
<p>[code]<br />
.lein\bin&gt; .\lein.bat self-install<br />
Downloading Leiningen now...<br />
SYSTEM_WGETRC = c:/progra~1/wget/etc/wgetrc<br />
syswgetrc = C:\Program Files (x86)\Gow/etc/wgetrc<br />

<p>Hmm, thats weird.  For some reason the cert isn't validating with wget (that I have installed via Gow).  </p>
<p>A quick google showed that this is a common problem using the gow wget, and I wasn't about to use the unsecured certificate check.  I opened up the leinigen installer bat file and saw that it does a check trying to see what kind of download function your shell has. It checks if you have wget, curl, or if you are in powershell (in which case it creates a .net webclient and downloads the target file).</p>
<p>Since I have gow in my path wget comes up first, so I just switched around the order and things now work happy!</p>
<p>The relevant section in the lein.bat file is</p>
<p>[code]<br />
:DownloadFile<br />
rem parameters: TargetFileName Address<br />
if NOT &quot;x%HTTP_CLIENT%&quot; == &quot;x&quot; (<br />
    %HTTP_CLIENT% %1 %2<br />
    goto EOF<br />
)<br />
call powershell -? &gt;nul 2&gt;&amp;1<br />
if NOT ERRORLEVEL 1 (<br />
    powershell -Command &quot;&amp; {param($a,$f) (new-object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile($a, $f)}&quot; &quot;&quot;%2&quot;&quot; &quot;&quot;%1&quot;&quot;<br />
    goto EOF<br />
)<br />
call curl --help &gt;nul 2&gt;&amp;1<br />
if NOT ERRORLEVEL 1 (<br />
    rem We set CURL_PROXY to a space character below to pose as a no-op argument<br />
    set CURL_PROXY=<br />
    if NOT &quot;x%HTTPS_PROXY%&quot; == &quot;x&quot; set CURL_PROXY=&quot;-x %HTTPS_PROXY%&quot;<br />
    call curl %CURL_PROXY% -f -L -o  %1 %2<br />
    goto EOF<br />
)<br />
call Wget --help &gt;nul 2&gt;&amp;1<br />
if NOT ERRORLEVEL 1 (<br />
    call wget -O %1 %2<br />
    goto EOF<br />
)<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Once the self install completes now lein is available.  </p>
<p>On a side note, I think you probably could have just downloaded the release file and plopped it into the <code>~/.lein/self-installs</code> folder and it would work too</p>
