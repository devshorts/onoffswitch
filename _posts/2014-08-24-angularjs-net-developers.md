A few months ago I was asked to be a technical reviewer on a new packt pub book called [AngularJS for .Net developers](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/learning-angularjs-net-developers). It mostly revolves around ServiceStack (not web API) and building a full stack application with angular. I actually really enjoyed reading it and thought it touched on a lot of great points that a developer who is serious needs to know about.

Unfortunately I think the book doesn't do a very good job at explaining angular in general. It's certainly geared to the experienced developer who has worked with angular and servicestack/c# REST before.

Still, if you are interested in using angular as a .net developer its an informative and quick read!
