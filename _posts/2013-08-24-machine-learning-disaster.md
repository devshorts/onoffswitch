If any of my readers are in the DC/MD/VA area you should all come to the next DC F# meetup that I'm organizing on september 16th (monday). The topic this time is machine learning from disaster, and we'll get to find out who lives and dies on the Titanic! We're bringing in guest speaker [Phil Trelford](http://trelford.com/blog/) so you know its going to be awesome! Phil is in the DC area on his way to the [F# skills matters conference](skillsmatter.com/event/scala/progressive-f-tutorials-nyc) in NYC a few days later. I won't be there but I expect that it will be top notch since all the big F# players are there (such as Don Syme and Tomas Petricek)!.
