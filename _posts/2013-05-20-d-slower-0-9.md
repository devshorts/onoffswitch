I learned an interesting thing today about regular expressions via this [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16621738/d-less-efficient-than-0-9) question. `\d`, commonly used as a shorthand for digits (which we usually think of as `0-9`) actually checks against all valid [unicode digits](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/Nd/list.htm).

Given that, it makes sense why `\d` in a regular expression is slower, since it has to check against all possible digit types. In C# you can limit the regular expression to use ECMAScript standards which doesn't include the full unicode subset of digits.

While I'm neither the question asker nor answerer, I wanted to share since this is something I didn't know about before.
