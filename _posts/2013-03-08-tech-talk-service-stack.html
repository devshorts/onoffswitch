<p>Today's tech talk the team and I talked about <a href="http://www.servicestack.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ServiceStack</a>. I've heard a lot of hype about it but never really understood what it did or was about. Today, unfortunately, didn't really clear any of that up.</p>
<p>We watched the ServiceStack powerpoint on their site and went to their <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github</a> to look at the examples. What I got out of all of that is that ServiceStack  is trying to simplify the creation of service oriented architectures (SOA) by providing a complete stack architecture for you to use (an ORM, backing cache/NoSql, routes, serialization, etc). </p>
<p>The confusion, however, lays in the fact that most other solutions are doing nearly the same thing. MVC has routes and web-api's with GET/POST/PUT/DELETE methods. WCF exposes transport independent RPC. Node.js has routes with auto fill parameters. Everyone is using JSON serialization.  Redis is common as a caching layer. A bunch of ORM's already exist for SQL. Enforcement of lightweight DTO's.  I couldn't really tell what made ServiceStack so much better than anything else.  </p>
<p>ServiceStack boasts of a faster ORM then NHibernate and Entity Framework, as well as the fastest .NET JSON serializer, but the comparison charts were almost 3 years old (a lifetime in technology!).  I did see that ServiceStack was less verbose to get set up making a web-api than MVC4, but the code looked pretty similar. If you rolled an app using any ORM, MVC or WCF, created your own DTO's, and sent everything over JSON then I think you basically have ServiceStack?  Frankly I'm as confused as ever.</p>
<p>The team, I think, feels the same way I do. We didn't have a very spirited conversation because everyone was a little lost as to what the significance of ServiceStack was.  We came out of it thinking that maybe to appreciate ServiceStack's offerings better that we should have a hack day to build a small service oriented application in node.js, MVC4, IIS hosted WCF, and ServiceStack.  </p>
<p>But, from my few hours of looking at the examples I'm not really sold on what is so great about it. </p>
