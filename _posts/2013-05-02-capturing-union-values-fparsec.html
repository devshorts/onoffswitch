<p>I just started playing with <a href="http://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fparsec</a> which is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">parser combinatorics</a> library that lets you create chainable parsers to parse DSL's.  After having built my own parser, lexer, and interpreter, playing with other libraries is really fun, I like seeing how others have done it.  Unlike my mutable parser written in C#, with FParsec the idea is that it will encapsulate the underlying stream state and result into a parser object.  Since F# is mostly immutable, this is how the underlying modified stream state gets captured and passed as a new stream to the next parser.  I actually like this kind of workflow since you don't need to create a grammar which is parsed and creates code for you (which is what ANTLR does).  There's something very appealing to have it be dynamic.  </p>
<p>As a quick example, I was following the <a href="http://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/tutorial.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tutorial</a> on the fparsec site and wanted to understand how to capture a value to store in a discriminated union. For example, if I have a type</p>
<p>[fsharp]<br />
type Token =<br />
     | Literal of string<br />
[/fsharp]</p>
<p>How do I get a <code>Literal("foo")</code> created?</p>
<p>All of the examples I saw never looked to instantiate that.  After a bit of poking around I noticed that they were using the <code>|>></code> syntax which is a function that is passed the result value of the capture.  So when you do</p>
<p>[fsharp]<br />
pstring &quot;foo&quot; |&gt;&gt; Literal<br />
[/fsharp]</p>
<p>You've invoked the constructor of the discriminated union similar to this:</p>
<p>[fsharp]<br />
let literal = &quot;foo&quot; |&gt; Literal<br />
[/fsharp]</p>
<p>Which is equivalent to</p>
<p>[fsharp]<br />
let literal = Literal(&quot;foo&quot;)<br />
[/fsharp]</p>
<p>This is because most of the fparsec functions and overloads give you back a Parser type</p>
<p>[fsharp]<br />
type Parser&lt;'TResult, 'TUserState&gt; = CharStream&lt;'TUserState&gt; -&gt; Reply&lt;'TResult&gt;<br />
[/fsharp]</p>
<p>Which is just an alias for a function that takes a utf16 character stream that holds onto a user state and returns a reply that holds the value you wanted.  If you look at <a href="http://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/reference/charstream.html#CharStream" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">charstream</a> it looks similar to my simple <a href="https://github.com/devshorts/LanguageCreator/blob/master/Lang/Lexers/TokenizableStreamBase.cs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tokenizer</a>.  The functions <code>|>></code>, <code>>>=</code>, and <code>>>%</code> are all overloads that help you chain parsers and get your result back.  If you are curious you can trace through their types <a href="http://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/reference/primitives.html#members.:62::62::61:" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. </p>
<p>Now, if you don't need to capture the result value and want to just create an instance of an empty union type then you can use the <code>>>%</code> syntax which will let you return a result:</p>
<p>[fsharp]<br />
let Token =<br />
    | Null<br />
let nullTest = pstring &quot;null&quot; &gt;&gt;% Null<br />
[/fsharp]</p>
<p>There are a bunch of overloaded methods and custom operators with fparsec. For example</p>
<p>[fsharp]<br />
let Token =<br />
    | Null<br />
let nullTest = stringReturn &quot;null&quot; Null<br />
[/fsharp]</p>
<p>Is equivalent to the <code>>>%</code> example.  </p>
<p>It's a little overwhelming trying to figure out how all the combinators are pieced together, but that's part of the fun of learning something new.</p>
